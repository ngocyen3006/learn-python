1. `*`, `-`, `+`, `/` are operators. And `'hello'`, `-88.8`, `5` are values.
2. `spam` is a variable, and `'spam'` is a string.
3. Three data types are string (`str()`), integer (`int()`), floating-point (`float()`).
4. An expresstion is made up of values and operators, and all expressions produce result.
5. An statement can assign value to variable and expression can not. 
6. `bacon = 20`
7. The result of two expressions `'spam' + 'spamspam'` and `'spam' * 3` is the same.
8. `eggs` is a valid variable name while `100` is **invalid** because `100` infringe of
    legal variable names: _it starts with a digit_.
9. Three functions are `str()`, `int()`, `float()`.
10. `'I have eaten ' + 99 + 'burritos.'`
    This expression cause an error because python can't use the `+` operator on
    a string and an integer value.

    We can fix it with `'I have eaten ' + '99' + 'burritos.'`
