   A function call is used to the code in a function execute.
5. There is one global scope, and a local scope is created whenever a function is called.
6. When the function call returns, variables in a local scope will be forgotten, the local scope is destroyed.
7. A value that a function call evaluates to is a return value. A return value be a part of an expression.
8. If a function does not have a return statement, when we call a function, it will return `None`.
