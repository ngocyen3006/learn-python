1.  `[]` is a empty list.
2.

```python

```

3. `'d'`
4. `'d'`
5. `['a', 'b']`
6. `1`
7. `bacon = [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True, 99]`
8. `bacon = [3.14, 11, 'cat', True]`
9. The operator for list concatenation is `+`, while the operator for replication is `*`.
10. `append()` is a function add a value only to the end of a list, `insert()` can add a value anywhere in a list.
11. We can use `remove()` or `del` statement.
12. Both lists and strings can be used to len(), have indexes and slices, be used in for loops, be concatenated or replicated, and be used with the in and not in operators.
13. list is defined by `[]`, tuple is defined by `()`, list can add, remove, change values, tuple cannot be changed at all.
14. `(42,)`
15. Used `tuple()` and `list()` function.
16. They contain references to list values.
17. `copy.copy()` will copy values of a list.
`copy.deepcopy()` will copy lists of a list.
